# Multi-Agent Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

The aiMMar application consists of a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI Python backend. Previously deployed on Vercel (backend) and Cloudflare Pages (frontend) but encountered authentication blocking issues. User now requests deployment preparation for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as an alternative hosting solution.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Previous Deployment Challenges (Vercel/Cloudflare)**:
1. **Vercel Authentication Protection**: Platform-level authentication blocked all API requests with 401 errors
2. **Service Separation**: Frontend and backend required separate deployments with complex CORS configuration
3. **Environment Variable Management**: Multiple platforms required different configuration approaches

**GCP Deployment Strategic Analysis**:
1. **Architecture Options**:
   - **Cloud Run** (Recommended): Serverless, containerized deployment with automatic scaling
   - **App Engine**: Fully managed platform with integrated services but higher costs
   - **Compute Engine**: VM-based hosting with full control but more maintenance overhead

2. **Frontend Hosting Options**:
   - **Cloudflare Pages**: Fast global CDN, automatic HTTPS, integrated with GitHub
   - **Firebase Hosting**: Alternative GCP integration option
   - **Cloud Storage + Cloud CDN**: Cost-effective static hosting alternative

3. **Database Strategy**:
   - **Option A**: Keep NeonDB (external) - lower GCP costs, proven working setup
   - **Option B**: Migrate to Cloud SQL - full GCP integration, unified billing, better performance within GCP

4. **Deployment Complexity**: GCP offers unified deployment through Cloud Build vs multi-platform configuration

5. **Cost Optimization**: Pay-per-use Cloud Run vs fixed App Engine costs, unified billing vs external services

## Verifiable Success Criteria
